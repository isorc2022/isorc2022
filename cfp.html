  <div class="subTitle">Guidelines for Manuscript</div>
  <p>IEEE ISORC 2022 invites papers in two categories. Submission guidelines for each category of paper are as follows:</p>

  <p><strong>Regular Research Papers:</strong> Papers should describe original work and be maximum 8 pages in length using the IEEE paper format. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Short Papers:</strong> Short research papers, 4 pages or less using the IEEE format, on real-time analytics are also invited, and should contain enough information for the program committee to understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or approach. The short papers will be not be published in the IEEE ISORC proceeding.</p>
  <p><strong>Double blind:</strong>Following the previous years’ experience, ISORC will continue to employ the double-blind review process and a rebuttal phase this year.Following the previous years’ experience, ISORC will continue to employ the double-blind review process and a rebuttal phase this year.</p>

  <!-- <p>IEEE ISORC 2021 invites papers in three categories. Submission guidelines for each category of paper are as follows:</p>
  <p>1. Regular Research Papers: Papers should describe original work and papers
  submitted for review should be a maximum of 8 pages in length, excluding
  references, using the IEEE conference paper format. A maximum of two extra pages
  may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers.</p>
  <p>2. Industrial Papers and Practitioner Reports: Papers describing experiences of
  using ORC technology in application or tool development projects, are an integral
  part of the technical program of ISORC. These papers should be no longer than 8
  pages, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format and may be
  less formal than research papers. They should clearly identify and discuss in detail
  the issues that represent notable industrial advances. Reports with project metrics
  supporting their claims are particularly sought, as well as those that show both
  benefits and drawbacks of the approaches used in the given project.</p>
  <p>3. Short Papers: Short research papers that are no longer than 4 pages, excluding
  references, using the IEEE conference paper format, on real-time analytics are also
  invited, and should contain enough information for the program committee to
  understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or
  approach.</p>
  <p>4 Double Blind Submissions: All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.</p>

<p>The IEEE conference paper templates can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">here</a> </p>

Papers are to be submitted through the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isorc2021">EasyChair</a> system.


  <div class="subTitle">Acceptance Criteria</div>
  <p>The review process is double-blinded. Authors’ identifiers, including name, affiliation and contact details, must not be revealed in the submission. The title page may list the authors
as “anonymous” and any reference to the prior works of the authors must be in the third person, i.e., references to your own prior work still include full author names. Similarly, if you
use your own software, state that a copy of this software was obtained from the authors of the software, preferably with a reference. Omit acknowledgements and funding sources in
the submission. The camera-ready submission for an accepted paper can restore these details. (Any further questions about double-blind submissions should be directed to the PC
chairs.)</p> -->

                ISORC has become established as the leading event devoted to state-of-the-art research in the field of object/component/service-oriented real-time distributed computing (ORC) technology. In addition to the main conference, ISORC 2020 will host a special session dedicated to posters and demos, where participants will be able to show prototypes, tools, simulators, and systems, which demonstrate the applicability of real-time computing to different applications. This year, ISORC will improve the peer-reviewing process by introducing double-blind submissions and a rebuttal phase, where authors will have a chance to provide short replies to the reviewers' major objections before the final acceptance decision is taken.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best Paper and Student Paper Awards will be delivered during the conference. Highly rated papers from ISORC 2020 will be invited for submission to a Special Issue of the Elsevier Journal of Systems Architecture (JSA).

                    <strong>Regular Research Papers:</strong>
                    Papers should describe original work and papers submitted for review should be a maximum of 8 pages in length, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers.

                    <strong>Industrial Papers and Practitioner Reports:</strong>
                     Papers describing experiences of using ORC technology in application or tool development projects, are an integral part of the technical program of ISORC. These papers should be no longer than 8 pages, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format and may be less formal than research papers. They should clearly identify and discuss in detail the issues that represent notable industrial advances. Reports with project metrics supporting their claims are particularly sought, as well as those that show both benefits and drawbacks of the approaches used in the given project.

            <div class="subTitle">Acceptance Criteria</div>
            <p align="justify"> The review process is <strong>double blinded</strong>. Authors’ identifiers, including name, affiliation and contact details, must not be revealed in the submission. The title page may list the authors as “anonymous” and any reference to the prior works of the authors must be in the third person, i.e., references to your own prior work still include full author names. Similarly, if you use your own software, state that a copy of this software was obtained from the authors of the software, preferably with a reference. Omit acknowledgements and funding sources in the submission. The camera-ready submission for an accepted paper can restore these details.  (Any further questions about double-blind submissions should be directed to the PC chairs.)
            </p>
            <div class="subTitle">Publication Information</div>
            All accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings published by IEEE.
            <strong style="color: #CF3964;">Each accepted paper shall be accompanied by at least one non-student
                registration.</strong>
                One of the authors of the paper must attend and present their work at the conference. Failure to present the paper in person can lead to the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.
